## About

Binary Beats React transforms binary counting into music. As a counter increments in binary (0-1023), each column plays a musical note when it changes to a "1". This creates interesting musical patterns based purely on the mathematics of binary counting.

This project is a modern reimplementation featuring:
- React component architecture
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Custom hooks for audio engine abstraction
- Responsive design for all devices

## Features

- 🎵 Binary-driven musical patterns
- 🎹 Customizable notes for each binary position
- 🎛️ Simple play/pause controls
- 🔄 URL-based sharing of custom note configurations
- 💻 Modern React implementation with hooks

## Usage

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Planned Features

- Multiple instrument options
- Sound effect controls (reverb, delay)
- Visual audio feedback
- Dark/light theme options
- Save/load functionality for configurations
- Advanced sharing options
