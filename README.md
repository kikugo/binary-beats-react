# Binary Beats React

A modern React and TypeScript implementation of the binary music concept, where binary counting creates musical patterns, featuring a dynamic audio visualizer.

## About

Binary Beats React transforms binary counting into music and visuals. As a counter increments in binary (0-1023), each column plays a musical note when it changes to a "1". This creates interesting musical patterns based purely on the mathematics of binary counting. The application also features a dynamic visualizer that reacts to the binary state.

This project is a modern reimplementation featuring:
- React component architecture
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Custom hooks for audio engine abstraction (`useToneAudio`) and state management
- Performant Canvas-based audio visualization
- Responsive design for all devices

## Features

- üéµ Binary-driven musical patterns using a reliable `Tone.PolySynth` engine.
- üìä **New!** Dual Visualizer Modes:
    - **Frequency Bars:** Visual representation of each bit's state.
    - **Waveform:** Dynamic wave generated from the active bits.
    - Click the visualizer to toggle modes!
- üé® Dynamic color schemes for the visualizer based on the binary value.
- üéπ Customizable notes for each binary position (functionality currently stable but UI temporarily simplified).
- üéõÔ∏è Simple play/pause controls.
- üîÑ URL-based sharing of custom note configurations.
- üíª Modern React implementation with hooks.
- ‚ú® Performance optimizations in both audio and visual rendering.
